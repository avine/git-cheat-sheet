# git-cheat-sheet

Simple GIT commands that produce a clean log history

## Initialize repository

**Create local repo:**

```bash
# create and navigate to new local repo
mkdir myrepo
cd myrepo

# init local repo with branch called "master"
git init

# create and commit file
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit --message "First commit"

# set url of remote repo called "origin"
git remote add origin https://github.com/myuser/myrepo.git

# verify added remote
git remote --verbose

# push local branch "master" to remote repo "origin"
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

**Or clone existing remote repo locally:**

```bash
# clone remote repo
git clone https://github.com/myuser/myrepo.git

# navigate to local repo
cd myrepo
```

## User config

Configure user name and email before commiting.

```bash
git config user.name "StÃ©phane Francel"
git config user.email contact@avine.io
```

## Status and log

```bash
git status
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

## Branches

```bash
# list all branches
git branch --all

# create new branch of master
git branch feature-one master

# checkout existing branch
git checkout feature-one

# or create and checkout new branch at once!
git checkout -b feature-one master

# delete a fully merged branch
git branch --delete feature-one

# delete a branch whether merged or not
git branch --delete --force feature-one
```

## Staging and unstaging

**For new untracked file:**

```bash
# creating new untracked file...
touch foo.txt

# add file to the index (tracking and staging)
git add foo.txt

# untrack file (use `git reset` without argument to reset all changes)
git reset -- foo.txt
```

**For already committed file:**

```bash
# modify file previously committed
echo "More Foo..." >> foo.txt

# staging the modification
git add foo.txt

# unstage the file but keep the modification
git reset -- foo.txt

# revert modification (ONLY for unstaged file)
git checkout -- foo.txt
```

## Revert all changes (staged on not)

```bash
# modify multiple files
echo "Foo..." >> foo.txt
echo "Bar..." >> bar.txt

# staging one of them
git add foo.txt

# Restore the working tree to HEAD
git reset -- --hard
```

## Delete file from the index and the working tree

```bash
# delete unmodified file from the index and the working tree
git rm foo.txt

# modify file
echo "More Bar..." >> bar.txt

# delete modified file (staged or not) from the index and the working tree
git rm --force bar.txt
```

## Delete file from the index but keep it in the working tree

```bash
# delete file (modified or not, staged or not) from the index but keep it in the working tree
git rm --cached foo.txt
```

After that, the file will be marked as untracked.

## Commit changes and amend last commit before push

```bash
# modify file
echo "Hello" >> foo.txt

# staging file
git add foo.txt

# commit changes with message
git commit --message "Hello World!"

# Oups! We forgot something!
echo "World!" >> foo.txt

# staging file
git add foo.txt

# amend the last commit (without modifying the message)
git commit --amend --no-edit

# push modified commit to the remote server safely
git push
```

## Amend last commit after push

```bash
# Push some previous commit to the remote server
git push

# Oups! We forgot something!
touch baz.txt
echo "Baz..." > baz.txt
git add baz.txt

# adding baz.txt to the last commit
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Overwrite the history on the remote server
git push --force
```

Do this ONLY if you DON'T work with a team!

## Amend last commit author

```bash
git commit --amend --author "John Doe <johndoe@avine.io>"
```

## Merging and rebasing

Assuming someone works on `feature-one`.

```bash
# clone repo and checkout new branch
git clone https://github.com/myuser/myrepo.git
git checkout -b feature-one

# create new file
touch fruits.txt

# modify, add and commit
echo "Orange" > fruits.txt
git add fruits.txt
git commit -m "Add orange"

# modify, add and commit again (option -am works for already tracked file)
echo "Banana" >> fruits.txt
git commit -am "Add banana"
```

*Logo history of branch feature-one:*

```txt
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* 484dbf6 (HEAD -> feature-one) Add banana
* c7fc421 Add orange
* 0285f89 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Initial commit
```

Meanwhile, someone else was working on `feature-two`...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myuser/myrepo.git
git checkout -b feature-two

touch technos.txt

echo "NodeJs" > technos.txt
git add technos.txt
git commit -m "Add NodeJs"

echo "Java" >> technos.txt
git commit -am "Add Java"
```

*Logo history of branch feature-two:*

```txt
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* 64364db (HEAD -> feature-two) Add Java
* 120e8c2 Add NodeJs
* 0285f89 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Initial commit
```

Next, the first developer is pushing his work.

```bash
# leave branch feature-one and go back to branch master
git checkout master

# merge feature-one into master (with no fast-forward)
git merge feature-one --no-ff -m "Merge feature-one"

# push commits to remote origin
git push origin
```

*Logo history of branch master:*

```txt
*   0f6ca39 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge feature-one
|\
| * 484dbf6 (feature-one) Add banana
| * c7fc421 Add orange
|/
* 0285f89 Initial commit
```

Now, how can the other developer also push his work ?

```bash
# from branch feature-two, update branch master...
git fetch origin master:master

# ...and rebase from master before merge (this will do the trick!)
git rebase master

# back to branch master, merge feature-two into master (with no fast-forward)
git checkout master
git merge feature-two --no-ff -m "Merge feature-two"

# push commits to remote origin
git push origin
```

*Logo history of branch master:*

```txt
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
*   8e5a570 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge feature-two
|\
| * 0aa4f57 (feature-two) Add Java
| * 1ad2fe8 Add NodeJs
|/
*   0f6ca39 Merge feature-one
|\
| * 484dbf6 Add banana
| * c7fc421 Add orange
|/
* 0285f89 Initial commit
```

Note: without rebasing from master before merging, the log history will not have been so clean!

We can also get a summary of branch master without the intermediate commits with the `--merges` option.
Merging branches with no fast-forward allows us to view each feature as a single merge commit.

```txt
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --merges
* 8e5a570 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge feature-two
* 0f6ca39 Merge feature-one
```

Note: another strategy you an choose, is to always rebase and do fast-forward merges in order to have a single line of history.

```txt
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* eee05a6 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD, feature-two) Add Java
* 4801abf Add NodeJs
* 8ec6840 Add banana
* cc3fdad Add orange
* 0285f89 Initial commit
```


---
WORK IN PROGRESS...

## Fetching from remote server

Assuming that new commits are available from remote server.
Thoses commits have been done by another developer.
And we also have finished our feature and we are ready to merge them into the master.

```bash
# back to master branch
git checkout master

# fetch changes from origin
git fetch origin

# apply changes using rebase strategy (not merge)
git rebase origin master

# or fetch and rebase at once!
git pull --rebase origin master
```

Now that you local repo is up-to-date, you can merge your feature branches on master as we did in the previous section.
